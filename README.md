Weed detection and removal is an essential task for a better crop yield as they compete for resources along with crops. Manual weed control methods are time-consuming and labour-intensive tasks with room for errors. The critical challenge is to reliably and accurately detect weed from the field.

Disease region irregularity problem Some rice diseases exhibit irregular shapes, and their target regions are small, making them difficult to detect Classification and localization problem Rice disease recognition employs identical features for both classification and localization tasks, affecting the training effect, to address the irregularity issue in the disease region a lightweight YOLOX for segmenting the RGB image into three classes crop, weed and background. The network results show convincing segmentation mask output on overlapping crop-weed images. 

Semantic Segmentation atisfying the requirement for real time identification of rice diseases and facilitating deployment in embedded devices by affecting the training effect. Leveraging pre-trained weights from larger Yolo networks like Yolo V8 or Yolo V9 to accelerate training and boost performance on smaller datasets. Training separate "Tiny Yolo" models tailored to specific rice leaf diseases (like bacterial leaf blight, brown spot, or rice blast) for increased precision in identification. 

Utilizing more complex data augmentation methods to generate diverse training images improving the model's robustness to variations in lighting, leaf angles and disease severity. Focus on further improving accuracy, real-time detection capabilities, adaptability to diverse growing conditions, and integration with drone-based imaging systems to enable large-scale field monitoring with minimal human intervention.
